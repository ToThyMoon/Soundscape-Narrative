My soundscape narrative portrays the final battle and climax of a recent Dungeons and Dragons campaign I played in. Dungeons and Dragons is a role playing game in which a Dungeon Master presents a story for the players to explore, all through the lense of a fantasy world. We played as Vyneth: a spellcasting bard specializing in illusion and mind spells, Sarreak: a sneaky rogue that excelled with bows, and Mag (me): a fighter capable of summoning echoes of himself. Throughout the campaign, our characters were ridding a city of an undead infestation. We had found the source of the undead plague and were about to launch an assault on it. The campaign culminated in us fighting a wight with its small army of undead. However, the situation changed drastically when an undead gnoll, a monstrous hyena turned undead, dropped from the ceiling, taking us by surprise. We narrowly defeated the horde, with a clever use of a spell, freeing the city from the grasps of the undead 
legion.

## Reflection

My soundscape narrative follows sounds of battle in this fight from the perspective of Sarreak the rogue. While I played Mag the fighter, Sarreak had a larger range of actions and was more central in the fight. Sarreak was more interesting from the perspective of sounds, so I chose him as the focal point. I made each action, such as casting a spell or attacking, in the game mirror the sounds it would make in the soundscape (see the planning document). 

My narrative plays out at about the same speed as it would have in the game. Each round is about six seconds, so the entire combat lasted about a minute to the characters. I wanted my narrative to keep pace with how it would have actually felt to the characters. Generally, each of the characters only takes an action every six seconds in the soundscape, and each action lasts anywhere from 0.5 seconds to the full 6 seconds. 

There were 4 main characters: the 3 players and the undead gnoll. The zombies (including the wight) were treated as a single character as well for the purposes of sounds. Each character gets 1 turn every round, able to do whatever they want. As such, the soundscape is incredibly chaotic by design. With 4-5 characters each taking an action, each with multiple sounds, every turn, the narrative became cluttered. I had to use a couple techniques to maintain some order.

Each character has a set of actions that are recognizable. Vyneth the bard had the same spell start-up sound every time he cast a spell. Sarreak the rogue generally sounded the closest to the listener. Mag the fighter had is clanging armor and sword sounds. His echo also had unique sounds played when summoning, attacking, and disappearing. The gnoll's sounds were more guttural, as well as lower pitched. The zombies had unique screams associated with them. The zombie screams all stemmed from one sound file that I added various effects onto, such as pitch and tempo change, invert, reverse, echo, reverb, etc. to make each sound fresh.

In addition to the recognizable actions, I also separated the actions of Sarreak and the gnoll from the others. Sarreak had run up some stairs on the right side of the building, so the others were to the left of Sarreak, execpt for the gnoll who dropped beside Sarreak. As such, I panned all the characters that were not Sarreak or the gnoll slightly to the left. This helped balance the main action, Sarreak and the gnoll, from the background sounds.

The battle lasted about 11 rounds, so there were over 50 turns of actions I had to make sounds for. The sounds weren't too difficult to find on freesound.org. However, very few sounds fit my narrative exactly. Most actions were usually constructed in other Audacity projects and exported to the main file. Some actions were similar, such as the fighter attacking with a sword for several turns, though I still had to vary the attacks to keep it sound fresh. The spells didn't need to be varied since they each did a exactly the same thing and sounded the same. 

I wanted the listener to feel like they were in the battle. I wanted to share this special moment I had with my friends to others. I wanted to make something worthy of the quality of the campaign I had the pleasure of being in. I feel like I succeded in reproducing the battle and reached my technical goals as well, using a variety of effects and learning new ways to use them. I had to scale back the background music I had planned, but I feel like that the narrative is complete even without it.

## Screenshots

### Armor Panning

I had a hard time making the fighter sound like he was advancing forward. Decreasing the sound made it seem like he was running directly away from the listener, which was not the intended effect. I looked up how to dynamically pan a sound and came up with the methood in the picture. The origin is panned to the starting location, and is faded out using the envelope tool. A second track panned to the destination is faded in using the envelope tool. The effect is remarkable, and feels like motion. 

### Gnoll Drop/Horror Build

One of the most important parts of the narrative is the moment the gnoll drops from the ceiling. It was a bone-chilling event in-game, and should be equally frightening in the soundscape. On its own, the gnoll dropped down pretty abruptly which broke the immersion of the narrative. While it was surprising in the game, it did not fit the soundscape. To fix this, I added a background effect, horrorBuild1, that builds up the tension to the drop. This effectively lets the listener know there is something bad coming without spoiling too much.

### Major Image

This is an image of the component sounds of the magorImage1 sound in the .aup file. This is the climax of the battle: the bard uses Major Image to summon a small army of illusory duplicates of the fighter's echo, confusing the gnoll and allowing us to finish it off. However, when I tried copying a lot of the echo summon sounds, the overlapping noises would pop and clip, likely due to how the echo noise itself is made. To solve this, I used the sounds separately, reducing the popping to a manageable level.
