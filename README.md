# Soundscape-Narrative
The Soundscape is based off the boss battle of one of my lastest Dungeons and Dragons campaigns. It is set from the perspective of one of the characters, Sarreak.

I have more or less finished the first 2 rounds of the battle, which is in game about 6 seconds per round, which I tried to match. I have included the initial walk up to the door, spellcasting and longbow attacks, and general zombie noises.
